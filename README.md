# SeaTurtleID (Project_rovirser)

Recognition of individuals is of great importance in both human and animal kingdoms. While for humans, there are rather negative applications, for animals it allows us to monitor endangered populations. One such project is the database SeaTurtleID, which was created as a collaboration between several universities (including CTU) and a Greek non-profit organization Archelon. This database contains over 7500 photos of 400 individual turtles. These photos are from different angles and distances.
